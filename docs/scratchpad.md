# Options Visualization Tool - Project Scratchpad

## Current Implementation Details

**Current Implementation**: [Options Visualization Tool](./implementation-plan/options-visualization-tool.md)
**New Task**: [Unified TypeScript Structure Migration](./implementation-plan/unified-typescript-structure.md)

## Project Status

**Current Status**: ✅ Unified TypeScript structure migration completed  
**Branch**: main  
**Last Updated**: [2024-12-19]

## Lessons Learned

### [2024-12-19] Project Structure Lessons
- **Lesson**: Having separate backend and frontend folders creates unnecessary complexity in TypeScript projects
- **Context**: User requested merging backend/frontend into unified TypeScript structure for better maintainability
- **Action**: ✅ Completed migration to unified monorepo structure with shared types and tooling
- **Result**: Achieved single dependency management, shared types, unified build system, and simplified development workflow

### [2024-12-19] Unified TypeScript Migration Success
- **Lesson**: Unified TypeScript monorepo structure provides significant benefits over separate frontend/backend folders
- **Benefits Achieved**: Single package.json, shared types, consistent ESM modules, unified development workflow
- **Technical**: Successfully converted CommonJS backend to ESM, implemented TypeScript project references, and maintained full functionality
- **Workflow**: `npm run dev` now starts both client and server concurrently, `npm run build` builds both targets

### [2024-12-19] TypeScript Configuration Error Resolution
- **Lesson**: Complex TypeScript project configurations with allowImportingTsExtensions and project references can conflict
- **Context**: After unified migration, TypeScript compilation errors appeared due to configuration conflicts
- **Technical Solution**: Simplified tsconfig hierarchy by removing project references and properly structuring noEmit settings
- **Key Fix**: useEffect return path issues in strict TypeScript mode require explicit early returns
- **Result**: ✅ Zero TypeScript errors, successful builds for both client and server components

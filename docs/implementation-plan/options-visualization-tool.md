# Options Visualization Tool - Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The treasury team needs a comprehensive options visualization tool to analyze their options positions overlaid on price charts. Currently, they are using manual processes or basic tools that don't provide the integrated view of options data (size, expiry, strike price) with underlying asset price movements.

**Key Business Value:**
- Enable treasury teams to make informed decisions about options positions
- Visualize options data in context of underlying asset price movements
- Provide easy CSV upload functionality for existing options data
- Create professional, TradingView-style charts for analysis

**Target Users:**
- Treasury teams managing options positions
- Financial analysts working with derivatives
- Portfolio managers overseeing risk exposure

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. **Data Integration**: Seamlessly combining real-time/historical price data with uploaded options data
2. **Visualization Complexity**: Creating intuitive overlays showing options size, expiry, and strike prices on price charts
3. **Performance**: Handling 2+ years of price data efficiently
4. **User Experience**: Making CSV upload and data visualization user-friendly for non-technical users

### Data Requirements
- **Price Data**: FET/USDT historical data for last 2 years from CoinGecko API
- **Options Data**: CSV upload with fields for size, expiry date, strike price, option type
- **Chart Display**: 1D bar chart with options overlays using color coding for different metrics

### Technology Stack Considerations
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for API endpoints
- **Data Processing**: pandas for options data handling, CoinGecko MCP for price data
- **Visualization**: TradingView Lightweight Charts (replacing Plotly)
- **Frontend**: React for production-ready UI with modal interface
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production (if needed)
- **UI Components**: Modal interface for option entry instead of CSV upload
